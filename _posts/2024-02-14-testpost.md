In this project I utilize EEG to investigate the neural correlate of tactile perception and how the brain processes stimuli below the perceptual threshold. Previous EEG studies applied weak near-threshold stimuli to the finger in a tactile detection paradigm to address this question. They found a mid latency ERP component (around 140 ms post stimulus) as a promising candidate the neural correlates of tactile detection, whereas earlier components such as the P60 seem to reflect physical stimulus properties (Forschack et al., 2020; Schr√∂der et al., 2021).
Electrical stimulation to the finger is favored in the laboratory setting, but it is unrealistic and might involve different processing than mechanical somatosensory stimuli. In this EEG study I make use of a near-threshold detection paradigm that includes mechanical stimulation to overcome this issue.
